# Virtual Advisors Evaluation
## Prompt
```
Situation description

Beautify is a global prestige cosmetics company that
sells its products mainly inside high-end department stores such as Harrods and
Shanghai No. 1. It also has a presence online with specialty retailers like
Sephora. Beautify produces a number of makeup, fragrance, and skin care products
sold under several different brands.

In department stores, beauty consultants
play a critical role with consumers:

approaching “passive” customers
demonstrating their knowledge of the products

actively selling the products
maintaining a loyal customer base of repeat buyers

These consultants are hired
directly by Beautify or through specialist, third-party agencies that find new
recruits for a fee. Beautify is then responsible for selecting, training, and
paying the consultants. Within Beautify, beauty consultants are managed
independently by each brand in each country. For example, this may mean a
consultant might be part of the Chanel team in a store. However, consumers are
shifting more to online shopping, and too many beauty consultants are left
working in empty department stores.

McKinsey study

Beautify’s president and
COO engaged McKinsey to help evaluate if training the majority of beauty
consultants to use virtual channels to connect with customers could be
profitable for the company.

Helpful hints

Write down important information.
Feel free to ask the interviewer to explain anything that is not clear to you.
Question 1:

Beautify is excited to support its current staff of beauty
consultants on the journey to becoming virtual social media-beauty advisors.
Consultants would still lead the way in terms of direct consumer engagement and
would be expected to maintain and grow a group of clients. They would sell
products through their own pages on beautify.com, make appearances at major
retail outlets, and be active on all social media platforms.

What possible
factors should Beautify consider when shifting this group of employees toward a
new set of responsibilities?

Question 2:

One of the key areas that Beautify
wants to understand is the reaction of current and potential new customers to
the virtual social media-beauty advisors.

Imagine you are a current Beautify
customer and you mostly shop at your local department store because you enjoy
the high-touch service offered by in-store consultants. What features would make
you consider switching to a mostly virtual sales experience?

Question 3:

The
discussion about virtual advisors has been energizing, but you’d like to ground
the discussion in some analysis. You’ve always found it helpful to frame an
investment in terms of how long it will take to turn profitable, such as when
incremental revenues are greater than the cost of the project.

You sit down
with your teammates from Beautify finance and come up with the following
assumptions.

With advisors, you expect ten percent overall increase in
incremental revenue—the team assumes that Beautify will gain new customers who
enjoy the experience as well as increased online sales through those engaged,
but it will also lose some to other brands that still provide more in-store
service. The team assumes this will happen in the first year.

In that first
year, Beautify will invest €50 million in IT, €25 million in training, €50
million in remodeling department store counters, and €25 million in inventory.
All-in yearly costs associated with a shift to advisors are expected to be €10
million and will start during the first year.

Beautify’s revenues are €1.3
billion.

How many years would it take until the investment in advisors turns
profitable?

## Response
### Chain-of-Though/Reasoning Chain (<think>{cot}</think>)
```
Year 2.

So, the payback period is 1.25 years, or approximately 1 year and 3
months.
```

### Final Output
```
To determine how long it will take for Beautify's investment
in virtual social
media-beauty advisors to become profitable, we need to analyze
the cash flows
over time.

### Assumptions:
1. **Incremental Revenue**: Beautify
expects a 10%
increase in incremental revenue in the first year, which amounts
to €130 million
(10% of €1.3 billion). This revenue is assumed to continue
annually.
2.
**Initial Investment (Year 0)**: €150 million (sum of IT, training,
remodeling,
and inventory costs).
3. **Ongoing Annual Costs**: €10 million
starting from
Year 1.

### Cash Flow Analysis:
- **Year 0 (Initial
Investment)**: -€150
million
- **Year 1**:
- Incremental Revenue: +€130
million
- Ongoing Costs: -€10
million
- Net Cash Flow: €120 million
-
Cumulative Cash Flow: -€150M + €120M =
-€30M
- **Year 2**:
- Incremental
Revenue: +€130 million
- Ongoing Costs: -€10
million
- Net Cash Flow: €120
million
- Cumulative Cash Flow: -€30M + €120M =
+€90M

### Payback Period
Calculation:
The initial investment is recovered when
cumulative cash flow turns
positive. After Year 1, the cumulative cash flow is
-€30 million. In Year 2, the
project generates another €120 million. The time
needed in Year 2 to cover the
remaining €30 million is:

\[
\text{Time} =
\frac{30 \text{ million}}{120 \text{
million}} = 0.25 \text{ years} \approx 3
\text{ months}
\]

### Conclusion:
The
investment will turn profitable
approximately 1 year and 3 months after the
initial investment.

**Final
Answer:** It will take approximately 1 year and 3
months, or 1.25 years, for the
investment in virtual advisors to become
profitable.
