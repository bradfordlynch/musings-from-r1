Okay, so the user is from a surfboard manufacturing company in Hawaii. They have
strong brand recognition and a solid distribution network there. The CEO wants
to expand their product line and revenues by entering the surfboard wax market.
They've hired us to figure out how big that market is in Hawaii. First, I need
to understand the context. Surfboard wax is a necessity for surfers to keep
their grip on the board. Since they're already in the surfboard business, moving
into wax makes sense because it's a complementary product. The company's
existing distribution channels can probably be leveraged here, which is a big
plus.
I should start by defining the market. Primary research would involve
surveys and interviews. Surveys can reach a lot of local surfers to get a sense
of their usage and spending habits. Interviewing surf shops and instructors
could provide insights into their sales data and customer behavior. Secondary
research would include looking at market reports and industry trends, especially
focusing on Hawaii's specific market.
Next, I need to figure out how many
surfers there are in Hawaii. Local surfing organizations or state tourism boards
might have that data. Also, considering how often surfers buy wax and how much
they spend each time will help estimate the market size.
Calculating the market
size involves looking at both individual consumers and retail sales. For
individual consumers, it's the number of surfers multiplied by their annual
expenditure on wax. For retail, it's the number of surf shops times their
average annual wax sales.
Competitive analysis is crucial. Who are the main
brands already selling wax in Hawaii? What are their market shares and pricing
strategies? Understanding the competition will help position the client's
product effectively.
Seasonality and demographics also play a role. Tourism
peaks in certain seasons, which might boost wax sales. Also, targeting different
segments like casual vs. professional surfers could influence marketing
strategies.
Finally, I should assess the feasibility of entering this market.
With their strong brand and distribution, they have advantages, but they'll
still need to consider production costs, marketing, and any potential challenges
like competition or supply chain issues.
Putting it all together, the market
size estimate will guide whether entering the surfboard wax market is viable and
profitable for the client. It will also help in strategizing how to capture a
good share of that market.
