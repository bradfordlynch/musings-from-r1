# Portfolio Model Monetization
## Prompt
```
A company has come up with a new portfolio construction model that presents a
novel way for investors to optimize for metrics beyond risk-adjusted return.
They are considering whether to target asset owners, asset managers, outsourced
investment consultants (OCIOs), or license with a traditional portfolio
construction platform (such as Blackrock's Aladdin). Please evaluate the merits
of the different avenues from a price and market penetration perspective. How
would they monetize and which avenue is most fruitful?

### Final Output
```
The optimal strategy for the company to market their new portfolio construction
model involves a targeted approach to maximize both monetization and market
penetration. Here's the structured plan: 1. **Primary Target: Outsourced
Investment Consultants (OCIOs)** - **Rationale**: OCIOs are a growing market,
and their role in managing multiple clients can amplify the tool's impact. They
are likely to adopt innovative solutions to enhance their offerings, making them
a sweet spot with moderate competition and strong growth potential. -
**Monetization**: Implement a tiered subscription model based on the number of
clients or assets under management, potentially including a revenue share to
align incentives. 2. **Secondary Target: Asset Managers** - **Rationale**: While
competitive, the large number of asset managers offers scalability. A
subscription model based on users or assets under management can cater to this
group effectively once initial traction is gained with OCIOs. 3. **Strategic
Partnership: Licensing with Traditional Platforms (e.g., Blackrock's Aladdin)**
- **Rationale**: Once the model is established, licensing can provide broad
market penetration. This long-term strategy should be pursued after gaining
credibility and user base to negotiate favorable terms. 4. **Direct Engagement:
Asset Owners** - **Rationale**: Approach asset owners for high-value contracts,
leveraging the tool's novelty and potential for significant revenue. This direct
sales approach can complement other strategies. By focusing first on OCIOs, the
company can leverage their growth and client base, then expand to asset managers
and strategic partnerships, ensuring a balanced approach that maximizes both
revenue and market reach.
